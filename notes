Q: can we have multiple main methods ??
=>function overload=>using same name for function but with  different arguments.
=>signaturse =>name of main method is same but arguments are different 


Data types

=>primitives Data types
    the data types that are defined by the langauge 
    used only for storing the values/literals
    specific amount of memory is assigned to these data types

    Boolean=>(def=>false)
        -boolean(1 byte /2 byte)
        =>false,true=>jvm decides how much memory they require to store these values
        => false=0, true=1  =>int =>4 short=>2 byte=>1
        0, 1 are integers=>integer data type
    numeric data type
        Character data types (def "\u000")
            char=> is used  to store characters( 2 bytes)
            java does not use ascii format=> 0-255 8bits=>2^8
            (hindi characters can not be recognized) numbers , alphabets, special characters

            unicode => 2 bytes=> 2^16=>possible combinations =>different languages recognized 
         
         integral data types
            integer(def literal in integers is of int type)
                byte(1 byte)(def =0)
                    8 bits=numbers=>sign +=0,-=1
                    remaining=>7
                    -2^7 to 2^7-1  => -128 to +127
                short(2 bytes) (def =0)
                int (4 bytes)(def =0)
                long(8 bytes)(def =0)
            floating point(literals by default double type)
                float (4 bytes)(def =0.0)
                double(8 bytes)(def=0.0)
=>Reference data type
    null is the deafult value for refeerences and cannot be assigned to primitive variables ever.
    => whenever your primitives not capapble of handling the data then you use ref data types

    what are Reference??
    =>they store address (Hash code) of objects

local variables => variables that are present inside any function or loops 
=>they have to be initialized before use
class variabes=> properties/ data members =>default value

=>memory distribution in jvm(thread safe => only thread can access that resource at a time)
    method area=>it keeps the definition of class
    heap area=>it keeps objects
    stack area=> it helps excution of program

command line arguments => giving input to program through command propm==>ide not possible run button
if you havent passeed any value to a reference=> null stored there

input /output in java
in out objects

primitives in the form of an objects=>wrapper class

int => Integer
float=> Float 
double => Double 
short => Short 
byte=> Byte
boolean => Boolean 
long => Long 
char => Character
